# Light Pollution Data Analysis - Phase 2

This notebook contains the Phase 2 work for the project **Monitoring Light Pollution using Satellite Data**.

### Tasks Completed:
- Data loading from sample CSV.
- Cleaning and preprocessing.
- Initial exploration of light intensity values.
- Visualization of trends.

The full dataset is too large to upload to GitHub, so only a small sample is included for demonstration.
