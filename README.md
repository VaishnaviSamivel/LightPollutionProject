# LightPollutionProject
Analyze nightlight data to monitor light pollution trends in Asia using Python.
This project analyzes VIIRS Nighttime Lights data (2013â€“2024) to study light pollution trends across Asian countries. Using Python and pandas/matplotlib, the project filters the dataset for Asia, aggregates nightlight intensity by year, month, and country, and generates informative plots to visualize trends.

The repository includes:

Original and filtered datasets

Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and plots

Saved visualizations (yearly, monthly, and country-wise)

A ready-to-run Python environment with dependencies listed in requirements.txt
